/*
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 
 * Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code, and execute that
 * block of code whenever we want and how ever many times we want.
 * Before we can use our function, we must first follow a set of rules
 * step by step.
 * 
 * 1. The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we 
 * can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a 
 * function by?
 * 
 * 2. What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and 
 * arguments PASSED to a function?
 * 
 * 3. What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
 * 
 * 4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
 * 
 * 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return 
 * a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify 
 * outputs?
 * 
 * 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or 
 * global scopes. The inverse is NOT true. 
 * 
 * 7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. 
 * If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory 
 * somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can
 * continue to exist in these closures!

// 1. Declaring the function and calling/invoking //
/*
 * Declaring the function and calling/invoking it is similar to setting
 * up a variable.  We use the function keyword to declare followed by
 * the name of our function.
 * 
 * Depending on the kind of function we want, we want to use parameters
 * that will a placeholder for values.  These parameters are seen right
 * after the function declaration, encased in paranthesis. ex (num1, num2);
 */
// 3. Syntax for a named function // 
function add(num1, num2){   // 2. num1, num2 are parameters
    return num1 + num2;
    // 5. We can specify the outputs through the return statement
}
add(2,5);   // 2. 2, 5 are arguments
/*
 * As seen above, calling our function is simple.  We can type the name of our
 * function followed by arguments. ex (2,5).  These arguments or values will be
 * used in our function to optionally take input and return a value.
 */
// 5. We can specify the inputs through the arguments
var x = add;  // 4. Assigning a function to a variable

// 6. Scope //
var num = 2;    // Global scope
function isNum(num){    // Local scope
    if(num === 1){
        console.log('Number is 1');
    } else{
        console.log('Number is not 1');
    }
}
/*
 * As seen in the example above, everything inside the function is considered a 
 * local scope.  Everything performed inside that local scope takes in the global scope but
 * will not affect the global scope outside the block.  The global scope is held outside of 
 * the function and affects the entire code.  As said as an example in class, a child can take
 * his/her parent's money, but a parent cannot take a child's money.
 */

// 7. Closures //
var globalVariable = 1;
function noClosure(){
    var funcVariable = 2;   // No Closure
    return funcVariable;
} 

function closure(){
    var funcVariable = 2 + globalVariable;  // Closure
    return funcVariable;
}

/**
 * Difference between function declaration and function exression
 */

// Function Declaration //
alert(foo()); // alerts 5
function foo(){
    return 5;
}
/**
 * A function declaration is loaded/hoisted before any code is executed.  Just as variable
 * declarations must begin with var, function declarations must begin with function..
 */
 
// Function Expression //
alert(foo()); // ERROR!
var foo = function(){
    return 5;
}
/**
 * A function expression is loaded only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. 
 * Since function expressions are not hoisted, they can retain a copy of the local variables
 * from the scope where they were defined.
