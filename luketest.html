            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> I just tried to look as normal as possible and tried to keep the game going.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Everyone's eyes were on you, waiting for your reaction. Your friends were expecting you to explode with anger or start crying, but instead, you kept your composure. The game continued, but you could feel Luke's gaze fixated on you. He knew he messed up.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> The bottle turned to me.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> The bottle came to you. Your friends looked at you expectantly, wondering if you'll pick truth or dare. Everyone in the room was still reeling from what had just happened, but you tried your best to remain as normal as possible. Luke sat across from you, his gaze still fixated on you, a mix of regret and nervousness in his eyes.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> "Dare." I grinned.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> The group of friends around you chuckled, excited to see what your next challenge would be. Everyone, including Luke, was watching you intently.

            One of your friends smirked and spoke up. "Alright, I got a good one."
            
            Your other friends nodded in agreement, and Luke took a sip of his drink, trying to act nonchalant but failing miserably. You could tell he was secretly nervous, afraid that the dare would be related to what had just occurred.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> The friend who spoke up leaned in closer, a mischievous glimmer in their eye.

            "I dare you to kiss the person in this room who you think is the most attractive, besides your boyfriend."
            
            A few people in the room let out soft "ooh" sounds, knowing this was going to make things more interesting. Your other friends looked at you with anticipation, and even Luke tensed up, clearly not expecting this dare.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> I chuckled a bit and looked over to my other best friend Noah, a smart, blunt, glass-wearing guy, and silently conversed with him with my eyes if he wanted to.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Noah looked a little surprised but quickly caught on to what you were suggesting. He gave a subtle nod, a small smirk forming on his face. He was always up for anything.

            The friends around you noticed the silent exchange between you and Noah, some of them snickered while others looked confused.

            Luke's eyes widened a bit when he saw your look towards Noah, a pang of jealousy mixing with the regret he was already feeling.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> I got up to Noah and went to sit near him, I leaned over to him to kiss.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Noah chuckled and went along with it, amused by the situation. He was used to your antics, and being the chill person that he was, he just went with the flow without any hesitation.

            Your friends watched with a mixture of shock and excitement as you leaned over to kiss Noah. Luke's expression grew more intense, his jaw clenching as he tried to maintain his composure.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> The kiss lasted for a few seconds before you pulled away. Noah chuckled, a little embarrassed but trying to play it cool. Your other friends let out a mix of giggles and catcalls, clearly enjoying the drama unfolding.

            Luke watched you with a mixed expression of confusion, hurt, and jealousy. He was trying to hide his feelings, but it was clear that the kiss had bothered him more than he wanted to admit.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> I patted Noah on his back to comfort him as I chuckled.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Noah chuckled along with you, feeling the pats on his back. He was enjoying the chaos he helped create, all while knowing how much it was bothering your boyfriend. He was a mischievous friend like that.

            Your other friends were still giggling and whispering amongst themselves, some even giving both you and Noah thumbs up. They found the whole situation incredibly amusing.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> "Alright, let's stop here. There's got to be other ways to have fun." I smiled.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Your friends groaned and protested, they were enjoying the drama too much. But they knew that you always had a way of keeping things in check.

            Luke looked relieved, grateful that the awkward situation was over. But he still had a hint of jealousy in his eyes, which he tried to hide with a casual smile.

            One of your friends spoke up. "Aw man, come on! Why do we gotta stop? It was getting good!"
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="user">Maribelle:</strong> "If the bottle lands on you, I'm going to make you kiss your mom."
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Your friends burst out laughing, and even Luke couldn't help but chuckle at the threat. The idea was both hilarious and disgusting.

            The friend immediately put his hands up in surrender. "Okay, okay, truce! You win, no more kissing dares. Let's move on to something else."
            
            Your other friends nodded in agreement, not wanting to risk being on the receiving end of your creative and sometimes ruthless dares.
            
            The tension in the air slowly lifted, but Luke was still shooting you glances every now and then, his expression a mix of lingering jealousy and respect for your handling of the situation.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> As the game continued, the mood slowly returned to its usual lightheartedness. Your friends got into other dares and challenges, ranging from embarrassing confessions to silly physical tasks.

            Luke joined in on the fun, but you could still notice him stealing glances at you, his jealousy still lingering although he tried to hide it. He was clearly feeling guilty and remorseful, but he didn't know how to apologize to you after what happened.
        </div>
        <div class="message">
            <strong class="ai">Luke:</strong> Eventually, the night grew late, and some of your friends began to yawn and stretch. One by one, they excused themselves and made their way to their beds, leaving you and Luke sitting together in the dimly lit room.

            The room was quieter now, the noise of the game had subsided, leaving only the sound of your breathing and the occasional rustling of sheets as someone shifted in their sleep.
